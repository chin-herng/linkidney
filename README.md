# LinKidney

LinKidney is an employment platform that offers great convenience for employers to hire kidney patients and provides employers access to detailed information about kidney patients.

## Description
### Background

The problem statement that we choose is “How can we get employers to empathize, understand, and hire kidney patients who have limited education levels and mobility due to their health conditions and treatment schedule?” 

To tackle this problem, our group decided to create LinKidney, an employment platform  that aims to increase the employment rate among kidney patients.

LinKidney allows kidney patients to seek jobs and recognize in-demand skills that raise their competitiveness. Consequently, employers can gain more understanding in kidney patients, while kidney patients have higher chances to be employed.

The target users of LinKidney are employers from small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and kidney patients. We insist on targeting mainly SME employers because we believe creating such a relationship between SME employers and kidney patients is a win-win strategy.

### Win-win Strategy

We can get employers to empathize, understand and hire kidney patients only if we understand their demands. 

What are the needs, or problems that current SMEs are facing?   

Through research, we concluded that limited workforce and resources are the predicaments that haunt current SMEs. According to a news article published on The Straits Time in August 2022, 58% of SMEs in Singapore stated their existing cash flow can only sustain them for less than six months. Concurrently, Singapore Business Federation’s latest National Business Survey (2022/2023) asserted that almost all businesses reported facing manpower issues. 

Therefore, we believe that the unemployed kidney patients could become one of the manpower sources for the SMEs.

According to an article from MyCareersFuture, employers can receive an Senior Employment Credit (SEC) to offset up to 16% of the wages of employees who have disabilities, indicating a reduction on company expenses.  

Besides, employers can apply training grants when they enroll their employees in Workfare Training Schemes, which returns them with improved employees.   

Moreover, employers should not be worried about the performance of kidney patients as employers can apply for grants and employment services to train and integrate the patients under the Open Door Programme (ODP).  

Hence, employers, particularly employers from SMEs who do not possess much funds for hiring proficient employees and do not require high-level-educated employees can be benefited by hiring kidney patients who have limited education level. Simultaneously, kidney patients can grab the opportunity to contribute to the enterprises and earn some money. 

Between both stakeholders, stands our platform, LinKidney which can convey and accomplish the win-win strategy.

## Usage

Although we choose to demonstrate the concept of our solution in the form of a webpage, due to its interactive property, it is also suitable to be implemented as a mobile application. LinKidney is a bidirectional employment platform, as our users can be employers from companies that are interested in hiring kidney patients, or kidney patients that are seeking a job. 

**Noted: Everything stated in this section is only applicable to the prototype, the usage of further implementation is stated in the Roadmap section.**

As clarification, we will use the term “employers” to represent employers from companies that are interested in hiring kidney patients, and the term “employees” to represent kidney patients that are seeking a job.

The pages in LinKidney are described below, some pages will have different interfaces for employers and employees.

### 1. Home Page

As the very first page when our user browses the web page, this page is identical for both employers and employees. After the users input a matching User ID and Password, they will be led to **2. Company / Employee Page**. The User ID and Password pair will be stored in our database. We can also facilitate our user to change their password if they have forgotten it.

Besides, users can also click into the **Individual** (user will be led to **3. Individual Page**) or **Business** (user will be led to **4. Business Page**) at the top of page to learn more about financial support or career path guidance for kidney patient and benefits for employers to hire kidney patients.

### 2. Company / Employee Page

After choosing a suitable job position, the users can proceed to choose their desired working environment or  job partners.

The employers can choose from a list of employees that have indicated their interest in this job in their profile and description. Above the list of employees, there are certain selection filters to focus the target to the expected working time of the employee, or they can directly search for the employee by his or her name.

The employers can peek through the detail bar of each employee at their preferred job position, expected working time and some simple additional information. The employee’s contact number and address are also stated on the right upper corner of their detail bar. If the employers want to know more about a particular employee, they can click on “learn more” and learn more details of the employee such as skills, healthcare schedule, previous work experience and previous employer feedback (if the previous job is seeked from LinKidney). Lastly, the employer can click “hire” to send a job invitation to the employee.

The employees can choose from a list of companies that have offered the job in their profile and description. Above the list of companies, there are certain selection filters to focus the target to the expected salary offered by the company, or they can directly search for the company by its name.
